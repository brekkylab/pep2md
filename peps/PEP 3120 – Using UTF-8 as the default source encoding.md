# Specification

This PEP proposes to change the default source encoding from ASCII to
UTF-8. Support for alternative source encodings (`263`{.interpreted-text
role="pep"}) continues to exist; an explicit encoding declaration takes
precedence over the default.

# A Bit of History

In Python 1, the source encoding was unspecified, except that the source
encoding had to be a superset of the system\'s basic execution character
set (i.e. an ASCII superset, on most systems). The source encoding was
only relevant for the lexis itself (bytes representing letters for
keywords, identifiers, punctuation, line breaks, etc). The contents of a
string literal was copied literally from the file on source.

In Python 2.0, the source encoding changed to Latin-1 as a side effect
of introducing Unicode. For Unicode string literals, the characters were
still copied literally from the source file, but widened on a
character-by-character basis. As Unicode gives a fixed interpretation to
code points, this algorithm effectively fixed a source encoding, at
least for files containing non-ASCII characters in Unicode literals.

`263`{.interpreted-text role="pep"} identified the problem that you can
use only those Unicode characters in a Unicode literal which are also in
Latin-1, and introduced a syntax for declaring the source encoding. If
no source encoding was given, the default should be ASCII. For
compatibility with Python 2.0 and 2.1, files were interpreted as Latin-1
for a transitional period. This transition ended with Python 2.5, which
gives an error if non-ASCII characters are encountered and no source
encoding is declared.

# Rationale

With `263`{.interpreted-text role="pep"}, using arbitrary non-ASCII
characters in a Python file is possible, but tedious. One has to
explicitly add an encoding declaration. Even though some editors (like
IDLE and Emacs) support the declarations of `263`{.interpreted-text
role="pep"}, many editors still do not (and never will); users have to
explicitly adjust the encoding which the editor assumes on a
file-by-file basis.

When the default encoding is changed to UTF-8, adding non-ASCII text to
Python files becomes easier and more portable: On some systems, editors
will automatically choose UTF-8 when saving text (e.g. on Unix systems
where the locale uses UTF-8). On other systems, editors will guess the
encoding when reading the file, and UTF-8 is easy to guess. Yet other
editors support associating a default encoding with a file extension,
allowing users to associate .py with UTF-8.

For Python 2, an important reason for using non-UTF-8 encodings was that
byte string literals would be in the source encoding at run-time,
allowing then to output them to a file or render them to the user as-is.
With Python 3, all strings will be Unicode strings, so the original
encoding of the source will have no impact at run-time.

# Implementation

The parser needs to be changed to accept bytes \> 127 if no source
encoding is specified; instead of giving an error, it needs to check
that the bytes are well-formed UTF-8 (decoding is not necessary, as the
parser converts all source code to UTF-8, anyway).

IDLE needs to be changed to use UTF-8 as the default encoding.
