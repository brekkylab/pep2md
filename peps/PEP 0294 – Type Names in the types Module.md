# Abstract

This PEP proposes that symbols matching the type name should be added to
the types module for all basic Python types in the types module:

    types.IntegerType -> types.int
    types.FunctionType -> types.function
    types.TracebackType -> types.traceback
     ...

The long capitalized names currently in the types module will be
deprecated.

With this change the types module can serve as a replacement for the new
module. The new module shall be deprecated and listed in
`4`{.interpreted-text role="pep"}.

# Pronouncement

A centralized repository of type names was a mistake. Neither the
\"types\" nor \"new\" modules should be carried forward to Python 3.0.

In the meantime, it does not make sense to make the proposed updates to
the modules. This would cause disruption without any compensating
benefit.

Instead, the problem that some internal types (frames, functions, etc.)
don\'t live anywhere outside those modules may be addressed by either
adding them to `__builtin__` or sys. This will provide a smoother
transition to Python 3.0.

# Rationale

Using two sets of names for the same objects is redundant and confusing.

In Python versions prior to 2.2 the symbols matching many type names
were taken by the factory functions for those types. Now all basic types
have been unified with their factory functions and therefore the type
names are available to be consistently used to refer to the type object.

Most types are accessible as either builtins or in the new module but
some types such as traceback and generator are only accessible through
the types module under names which do not match the type name. This PEP
provides a uniform way to access all basic types under a single set of
names.

# Specification

The types module shall pass the following test:

    import types
    for t in vars(types).values():
        if type(t) is type:
    assert getattr(types, t.__name__) is t

The types \'class\', \'instance method\' and \'dict-proxy\' have already
been renamed to the valid Python identifiers \'classobj\',
\'instancemethod\' and \'dictproxy\', making this possible.

# Backward compatibility

Because of their widespread use it is not planned to actually remove the
long names from the types module in some future version. However, the
long names should be changed in documentation and library sources to
discourage their use in new code.

# Reference Implementation

A reference implementation is available in [issue
#569328](https://bugs.python.org/issue569328).
