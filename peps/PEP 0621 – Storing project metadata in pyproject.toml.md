# Abstract

This PEP specifies how to write a project\'s [core
metadata](https://packaging.python.org/specifications/core-metadata/) in
a `pyproject.toml` file for packaging-related tools to consume.

# Motivation

The key motivators of this PEP are:

- Encourage users to specify core metadata statically for speed, ease of
  specification, unambiguity, and deterministic consumption by build
  back-ends
- Provide a tool-agnostic way of specifying metadata for ease of
  learning and transitioning between build back-ends
- Allow for more code sharing between build back-ends for the \"boring
  parts\" of a project\'s metadata

To speak specifically to the motivation for static metadata, that has
been an overall goal of the packaging ecosystem for some time. As such,
making it easy to specify metadata statically is important. This also
means that raising the cost of specifying data as dynamic is acceptable
as users should skew towards wanting to provide static metadata.

Requiring the distinction between static and dynamic metadata also helps
with disambiguation for when metadata isn\'t specified. When any
metadata *may* be dynamic, it means you never know if the absence of
metadata is on purpose or because it is to be provided later. By
requiring that dynamic metadata be specified, it disambiguates the
intent when metadata goes unspecified.

This PEP does **not** attempt to standardize all possible metadata
required by a build back-end, only the metadata covered by the [core
metadata](https://packaging.python.org/specifications/core-metadata/)
specification which are very common across projects and would stand to
benefit from being static and consistently specified. This means build
back-ends are still free and able to innovate around patterns like how
to specify the files to include in a wheel. There is also an included
escape hatch for users and build back-ends to use when they choose to
partially opt-out of this PEP (compared to opting-out of this PEP
entirely, which is also possible).

This PEP is also not trying to change the underlying [core
metadata](https://packaging.python.org/specifications/core-metadata/) in
any way. Such considerations should be done in a separate PEP which may
lead to changes or additions to what this PEP specifies.

# Rationale

The design guidelines the authors of this PEP followed were:

- Define a representation of as much of the [core
  metadata](https://packaging.python.org/specifications/core-metadata/)
  in `pyproject.toml` as is reasonable
- Define the metadata statically with an escape hatch for those who want
  to define it dynamically later via a build back-end
- Use familiar names where it makes sense, but be willing to use more
  modern terminology
- Try to be ergonomic within a TOML file instead of mirroring how build
  back-ends specify metadata at a low-level when it makes sense
- Learn from other build back-ends in the packaging ecosystem which have
  used TOML for their metadata
- Don\'t try to standardize things which lack a pre-existing standard at
  a lower-level
- *When* metadata is specified using this PEP, it is considered
  canonical

# Specification

When specifying project metadata, tools MUST adhere and honour the
metadata as specified in this PEP. If metadata is improperly specified
then tools MUST raise an error to notify the user about their mistake.

Data specified using this PEP is considered canonical. Tools CANNOT
remove, add or change data that has been statically specified. Only when
a field is marked as `dynamic` may a tool provide a \"new\" value.

## Details

### Table name

Tools MUST specify fields defined by this PEP in a table named
`[project]`. No tools may add fields to this table which are not defined
by this PEP or subsequent PEPs. For tools wishing to store their own
settings in `pyproject.toml`, they may use the `[tool]` table as defined
in `518`{.interpreted-text role="pep"}. The lack of a `[project]` table
implicitly means the build back-end will dynamically provide all fields.

### `name`

- Format: string
- [Core
  metadata](https://packaging.python.org/specifications/core-metadata/):
  `Name`
  ([link](https://packaging.python.org/specifications/core-metadata/#name))
- Synonyms
  - [Flit](https://flit.readthedocs.io/): `module`/`dist-name`
    ([link](https://flit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pyproject_toml.html#metadata-section))
  - [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/): `name`
    ([link](https://python-poetry.org/docs/pyproject/#name))
  - [Setuptools](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/): `name`
    ([link](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#metadata))

The name of the project.

Tools MUST require users to statically define this field.

Tools SHOULD normalize this name, as specified by
`503`{.interpreted-text role="pep"}, as soon as it is read for internal
consistency.

### `version`

- Format: string
- [Core
  metadata](https://packaging.python.org/specifications/core-metadata/):
  `Version`
  ([link](https://packaging.python.org/specifications/core-metadata/#version))
- Synonyms
  - [Flit](https://flit.readthedocs.io/): N/A (read from a `__version__`
    attribute)
    ([link](https://flit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#usage))
  - [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/): `version`
    ([link](https://python-poetry.org/docs/pyproject/#version))
  - [Setuptools](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/): `version`
    ([link](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#metadata))

The version of the project as supported by `440`{.interpreted-text
role="pep"}.

Users SHOULD prefer to specify already-normalized versions.

### `description`

- Format: string
- [Core
  metadata](https://packaging.python.org/specifications/core-metadata/):
  `Summary`
  ([link](https://packaging.python.org/specifications/core-metadata/#summary))
- Synonyms
  - [Flit](https://flit.readthedocs.io/): N/A
  - [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/): `description`
    ([link](https://python-poetry.org/docs/pyproject/#description))
  - [Setuptools](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/): `description`
    ([link](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#metadata))

The summary description of the project.

### `readme`

- Format: String or table
- [Core
  metadata](https://packaging.python.org/specifications/core-metadata/):
  `Description`
  ([link](https://packaging.python.org/specifications/core-metadata/#description))
- Synonyms
  - [Flit](https://flit.readthedocs.io/): `description-file`
    ([link](https://flit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pyproject_toml.html#metadata-section))
  - [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/): `readme`
    ([link](https://python-poetry.org/docs/pyproject/#readme))
  - [Setuptools](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/): `long_description`
    ([link](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#metadata))

The full description of the project (i.e. the README).

The field accepts either a string or a table. If it is a string then it
is the relative path to a text file containing the full description.
Tools MUST assume the file\'s encoding is UTF-8. If the file path ends
in a case-insensitive `.md` suffix, then tools MUST assume the
content-type is `text/markdown`. If the file path ends in a
case-insensitive `.rst`, then tools MUST assume the content-type is
`text/x-rst`. If a tool recognizes more extensions than this PEP, they
MAY infer the content-type for the user without specifying this field as
`dynamic`. For all unrecognized suffixes when a content-type is not
provided, tools MUST raise an error.

The `readme` field may also take a table. The `file` key has a string
value representing a relative path to a file containing the full
description. The `text` key has a string value which is the full
description. These keys are mutually-exclusive, thus tools MUST raise an
error if the metadata specifies both keys.

A table specified in the `readme` field also has a `content-type` field
which takes a string specifying the content-type of the full
description. A tool MUST raise an error if the metadata does not specify
this field in the table. If the metadata does not specify the `charset`
parameter, then it is assumed to be UTF-8. Tools MAY support other
encodings if they choose to. Tools MAY support alternative content-types
which they can transform to a content-type as supported by the [core
metadata](https://packaging.python.org/specifications/core-metadata/).
Otherwise tools MUST raise an error for unsupported content-types.

### `requires-python`

- Format: string
- [Core
  metadata](https://packaging.python.org/specifications/core-metadata/):
  `Requires-Python`
  ([link](https://packaging.python.org/specifications/core-metadata/#summary))
- Synonyms
  - [Flit](https://flit.readthedocs.io/): `requires-python`
    ([link](https://flit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pyproject_toml.html#metadata-section))
  - [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/): As a `python` dependency in
    the `[tool.poetry.dependencies]` table
    ([link](https://python-poetry.org/docs/pyproject/#dependencies-and-dev-dependencies))
  - [Setuptools](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/): `python_requires`
    ([link](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#metadata))

The Python version requirements of the project.

### `license`

- Format: Table
- [Core
  metadata](https://packaging.python.org/specifications/core-metadata/):
  `License`
  ([link](https://packaging.python.org/specifications/core-metadata/#license))
- Synonyms
  - [Flit](https://flit.readthedocs.io/): `license`
    ([link](https://flit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pyproject_toml.html#metadata-section))
  - [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/): `license`
    ([link](https://python-poetry.org/docs/pyproject/#license))
  - [Setuptools](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/): `license`,
    `license_file`, `license_files`
    ([link](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#metadata))

The table may have one of two keys. The `file` key has a string value
that is a relative file path to the file which contains the license for
the project. Tools MUST assume the file\'s encoding is UTF-8. The `text`
key has a string value which is the license of the project whose meaning
is that of the `License` field from the [core
metadata](https://packaging.python.org/specifications/core-metadata/).
These keys are mutually exclusive, so a tool MUST raise an error if the
metadata specifies both keys.

A practical string value for the `license` key has been purposefully
left out to allow for a future PEP to specify support for
[SPDX](https://spdx.dev/) expressions (the same logic applies to any
sort of \"type\" field specifying what license the `file` or `text`
represents).

### `authors`/`maintainers`

- Format: Array of inline tables with string keys and values
- [Core
  metadata](https://packaging.python.org/specifications/core-metadata/):
  `Author`/`Author-email`/`Maintainer`/`Maintainer-email`
  ([link](https://packaging.python.org/specifications/core-metadata/#author))
- Synonyms
  - [Flit](https://flit.readthedocs.io/):
    `author`/`author-email`/`maintainer`/`maintainer-email`
    ([link](https://flit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pyproject_toml.html#metadata-section))
  - [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/): `authors`/`maintainers`
    ([link](https://python-poetry.org/docs/pyproject/#authors))
  - [Setuptools](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/):
    `author`/`author_email`/`maintainer`/`maintainer_email`
    ([link](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#metadata))

The people or organizations considered to be the \"authors\" of the
project. The exact meaning is open to interpretation --- it may list the
original or primary authors, current maintainers, or owners of the
package.

The \"maintainers\" field is similar to \"authors\" in that its exact
meaning is open to interpretation.

These fields accept an array of tables with 2 keys: `name` and `email`.
Both values must be strings. The `name` value MUST be a valid email name
(i.e. whatever can be put as a name, before an email, in
`822`{.interpreted-text role="rfc"}) and not contain commas. The `email`
value MUST be a valid email address. Both keys are optional.

Using the data to fill in [core
metadata](https://packaging.python.org/specifications/core-metadata/) is
as follows:

1.  If only `name` is provided, the value goes in `Author`/`Maintainer`
    as appropriate.
2.  If only `email` is provided, the value goes in
    `Author-email`/`Maintainer-email` as appropriate.
3.  If both `email` and `name` are provided, the value goes in
    `Author-email`/`Maintainer-email` as appropriate, with the format
    `{name} <{email}>` (with appropriate quoting, e.g. using
    `email.headerregistry.Address`).
4.  Multiple values should be separated by commas.

### `keywords`

- Format: array of strings
- [Core
  metadata](https://packaging.python.org/specifications/core-metadata/):
  `Keywords`
  ([link](https://packaging.python.org/specifications/core-metadata/#keywords))
- Synonyms
  - [Flit](https://flit.readthedocs.io/): `keywords`

  - [Setuptools](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/): `keywords`
    ([link](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#metadata))

The keywords for the project.

### `classifiers`

- Format: array of strings
- [Core
  metadata](https://packaging.python.org/specifications/core-metadata/):
  `Classifier`
  ([link](https://packaging.python.org/specifications/core-metadata/#classifier-multiple-use))
- Synonyms
  - [Flit](https://flit.readthedocs.io/): `classifiers`
    ([link](https://flit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pyproject_toml.html#metadata-section))
  - [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/): `classifiers`
    ([link](https://python-poetry.org/docs/pyproject/#classifiers))
  - [Setuptools](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/): `classifiers`
    ([link](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#metadata))

[Trove classifiers](https://pypi.org/classifiers/) which apply to the
project.

### `urls`

- Format: Table, with keys and values of strings
- [Core
  metadata](https://packaging.python.org/specifications/core-metadata/):
  `Project-URL`
  ([link](https://packaging.python.org/specifications/core-metadata/#project-url-multiple-use))
- Synonyms
  - [Flit](https://flit.readthedocs.io/): `[tool.flit.metadata.urls]`
    table
    ([link](https://flit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pyproject_toml.html#metadata-section))
  - [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/): `[tool.poetry.urls]` table
    ([link](https://python-poetry.org/docs/pyproject/#urls))
  - [Setuptools](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/): `project_urls`
    ([link](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#metadata))

A table of URLs where the key is the URL label and the value is the URL
itself.

### Entry points

- Format: Table (`[project.scripts]`, `[project.gui-scripts]`, and
  `[project.entry-points]`)
- [Core
  metadata](https://packaging.python.org/specifications/core-metadata/):
  N/A; [Entry points
  specification](https://packaging.python.org/specifications/entry-points/)
- Synonyms
  - [Flit](https://flit.readthedocs.io/): `[tool.flit.scripts]` table
    for console scripts, `[tool.flit.entrypoints]` for the rest
    ([link](https://flit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pyproject_toml.html#scripts-section))
  - [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/): `[tool.poetry.scripts]` table
    for console scripts
    ([link](https://python-poetry.org/docs/pyproject/#scripts))
  - [Setuptools](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/): `entry_points`
    ([link](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#metadata))

There are three tables related to entry points. The `[project.scripts]`
table corresponds to the `console_scripts` group in the [entry points
specification](https://packaging.python.org/specifications/entry-points/).
The key of the table is the name of the entry point and the value is the
object reference.

The `[project.gui-scripts]` table corresponds to the `gui_scripts` group
in the [entry points
specification](https://packaging.python.org/specifications/entry-points/).
Its format is the same as `[project.scripts]`.

The `[project.entry-points]` table is a collection of tables. Each
sub-table\'s name is an entry point group. The key and value semantics
are the same as `[project.scripts]`. Users MUST NOT create nested
sub-tables but instead keep the entry point groups to only one level
deep.

Build back-ends MUST raise an error if the metadata defines a
`[project.entry-points.console_scripts]` or
`[project.entry-points.gui_scripts]` table, as they would be ambiguous
in the face of `[project.scripts]` and `[project.gui-scripts]`,
respectively.

### `dependencies`/`optional-dependencies`

- Format: Array of `508`{.interpreted-text role="pep"} strings
  (`dependencies`) and a table with values of arrays of
  `508`{.interpreted-text role="pep"} strings (`optional-dependencies`)
- [Core
  metadata](https://packaging.python.org/specifications/core-metadata/):
  `Requires-Dist` and `Provides-Extra`
  ([link](https://packaging.python.org/specifications/core-metadata/#requires-dist-multiple-use),
  [link](https://packaging.python.org/specifications/core-metadata/#provides-extra-multiple-use))
- Synonyms
  - [Flit](https://flit.readthedocs.io/): `requires` for required
    dependencies, `requires-extra` for optional dependencies
    ([link](https://flit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pyproject_toml.html#metadata-section))
  - [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/): `[tool.poetry.dependencies]`
    for dependencies (both required and for development),
    `[tool.poetry.extras]` for optional dependencies
    ([link](https://python-poetry.org/docs/pyproject/#dependencies-and-dev-dependencies))
  - [Setuptools](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/): `install_requires`
    for required dependencies, `extras_require` for optional
    dependencies
    ([link](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#metadata))

The (optional) dependencies of the project.

For `dependencies`, it is a key whose value is an array of strings. Each
string represents a dependency of the project and MUST be formatted as a
valid `508`{.interpreted-text role="pep"} string. Each string maps
directly to a `Requires-Dist` entry in the [core
metadata](https://packaging.python.org/specifications/core-metadata/).

For `optional-dependencies`, it is a table where each key specifies an
extra and whose value is an array of strings. The strings of the arrays
must be valid `508`{.interpreted-text role="pep"} strings. The keys MUST
be valid values for the `Provides-Extra` [core
metadata](https://packaging.python.org/specifications/core-metadata/).
Each value in the array thus becomes a corresponding `Requires-Dist`
entry for the matching `Provides-Extra` metadata.

### `dynamic`

- Format: Array of strings
- [Core
  metadata](https://packaging.python.org/specifications/core-metadata/):
  N/A
- No synonyms

Specifies which fields listed by this PEP were intentionally unspecified
so another tool can/will provide such metadata dynamically. This clearly
delineates which metadata is purposefully unspecified and expected to
stay unspecified compared to being provided via tooling later on.

- A build back-end MUST honour statically-specified metadata (which
  means the metadata did not list the field in `dynamic`).
- A build back-end MUST raise an error if the metadata specifies the
  `name` in `dynamic`.
- If the [core
  metadata](https://packaging.python.org/specifications/core-metadata/)
  specification lists a field as \"Required\", then the metadata MUST
  specify the field statically or list it in `dynamic` (build back-ends
  MUST raise an error otherwise, i.e. it should not be possible for a
  required field to not be listed somehow in the `[project]` table).
- If the [core
  metadata](https://packaging.python.org/specifications/core-metadata/)
  specification lists a field as \"Optional\", the metadata MAY list it
  in `dynamic` if the expectation is a build back-end will provide the
  data for the field later.
- Build back-ends MUST raise an error if the metadata specifies a field
  statically as well as being listed in `dynamic`.
- If the metadata does not list a field in `dynamic`, then a build
  back-end CANNOT fill in the requisite metadata on behalf of the user
  (i.e. `dynamic` is the only way to allow a tool to fill in metadata
  and the user must opt into the filling in).
- Build back-ends MUST raise an error if the metadata specifies a field
  in dynamic but the build back-end was unable to provide the data for
  it.

# Backwards Compatibility

As this provides a new way to specify a project\'s [core
metadata](https://packaging.python.org/specifications/core-metadata/)
and is using a new table name which falls under the reserved namespace
as outlined in `518`{.interpreted-text role="pep"}, there are no
backwards-compatibility concerns.

# Security Implications

There are no direct security concerns as this PEP covers how to
statically define project metadata. Any security issues would stem from
how tools consume the metadata and choose to act upon it.

# Reference Implementation

There are currently no proofs-of-concept from any build back-end
implementing this PEP.

# Rejected Ideas

## Other table names

### Anything under `[build-system]`

There was worry that using this table name would exacerbate confusion
between build metadata and project metadata, e.g. by using
`[build-system.metadata]` as a table.

### `[package]`

Garnered no strong support.

### `[metadata]`

The strongest contender after `[project]`, but in the end it was agreed
that `[project]` read better for certain sub-tables, e.g.
`[project.urls]`.

## Support for a metadata provider

Initially there was a proposal to add a middle layer between the static
metadata specified by this PEP and `prepare_metadata_for_build_wheel()`
as specified by `517`{.interpreted-text role="pep"}. The idea was that
if a project wanted to insert itself between a build back-end and the
metadata there would be a hook to do so.

In the end the authors considered this idea unnecessarily complicated
and would move the PEP away from its design goal to push people to
define core metadata statically as much as possible.

## Require a normalized project name

While it would make things easier for tools to only work with the
normalized name as specified in `503`{.interpreted-text role="pep"}, the
idea was ultimately rejected as it would hurt projects transitioning to
using this PEP.

## Specify files to include when building

The authors decided fairly quickly during design discussions that this
PEP should focus exclusively on project metadata and not build metadata.
As such, specifying what files should end up in a source distribution or
wheel file is out of scope for this PEP.

## Name the `[project.urls]` table `[project.project-urls]`

This suggestion came thanks to the corresponding [core
metadata](https://packaging.python.org/specifications/core-metadata/)
being `Project-Url`. But once the overall table name of `[project]` was
chosen, the redundant use of the word \"project\" suggested the current,
shorter name was a better fit.

## Have a separate `url`/`home-page` field

While the [core
metadata](https://packaging.python.org/specifications/core-metadata/)
supports it, having a single field for a project\'s URL while also
supporting a full table seemed redundant and confusing.

## Recommend that tools put development-related dependencies into a \"dev\" extra

As various tools have grown the concept of required dependencies versus
development dependencies, the idea of suggesting to tools that they put
such development tool into a \"dev\" grouping came up. In the end,
though, the authors deemed it out-of-scope for this specification to
suggest such a workflow.

## Have the `dynamic` field only require specifying missing required fields

The authors considered the idea that the `dynamic` field would only
require the listing of missing required fields and make listing optional
fields optional. In the end, though, this went against the design goal
of promoting specifying as much information statically as possible.

## Different structures for the `readme` field

The `readme` field had a proposed `readme_content_type` field, but the
authors considered the string/table hybrid more practical for the common
case while still accommodating the more complex case. Same goes for
using `long_description` and a corresponding
`long_description_content_type` field.

The `file` key in the table format was originally proposed as `path`,
but `file` corresponds to setuptools\' `file` key and there is no strong
reason otherwise to choose one over the other.

## Allowing the `readme` field to imply `text/plain`

The authors considered allowing for unspecified content-types which
would default to `text/plain`, but decided that it would be best to be
explicit in this case to prevent accidental incorrect renderings on PyPI
and to force users to be clear in their intent.

## Other names for `dependencies`/`optional-dependencies`

The authors originally proposed `requires`/`extra-requires` as names,
but decided to go with the current names after a survey of other
packaging ecosystems showed Python was an outlier:

1.  [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#optionaldependencies)
2.  [Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/guide/dependencies.html)
3.  [Dart](https://dart.dev/guides/packages)
4.  [Swift](https://swift.org/package-manager/)
5.  [Ruby](https://guides.rubygems.org/specification-reference/#add_runtime_dependency)

Normalizing on the current names helps minimize confusion for people
coming from other ecosystems without using terminology that is
necessarily foreign to new programmers. It also prevents potential
confusion with `requires` in the `[build-system]` table as specified in
`518`{.interpreted-text role="pep"}.

## Drop `maintainers` to unify with `authors`

As the difference between `Authors` and `Maintainers` fields in the
[core
metadata](https://packaging.python.org/specifications/core-metadata/) is
unspecified and ambiguous, this PEP originally proposed unifying them as
a single `authors` field. Other ecosystems have selected \"author\" as
the term to use, so the thinking was to standardize on `Author` in the
core metadata as the place to list people maintaining a project.

In the end, though, the decision to adhere to the core metadata was
deemed more important to help with the acceptance of this PEP, rather
than trying to introduce a new interpretation for some of the core
metadata.

## Support an arbitrary depth of tables for `project.entry-points`

There was a worry that keeping `project.entry-points` to a depth of 1
for sub-tables would cause confusion to users if they use a dotted name
and are not used to table names using quotation marks (e.g.
`project.entry-points."spam.magical"`). But supporting an arbitrary
depth \-- e.g. `project.entry-points.spam.magical` \-- would preclude
any form of an exploded table format in the future. It would also
complicate things for build back-ends as they would have to make sure to
traverse the full table structure rather than a single level and raising
errors as appropriate on value types.

## Using structured TOML dictionaries to specify dependencies

The format for specifying the dependencies of a project was the most
hotly contested topic in terms of data format. It led to the creation of
both `631`{.interpreted-text role="pep"} and `633`{.interpreted-text
role="pep"} which represent what is in this PEP and using TOML
dictionaries more extensively, respectively. The decision on those PEPs
can be found at
<https://discuss.python.org/t/how-to-specify-dependencies-pep-508-strings-or-a-table-in-toml/5243/38>.

The authors briefly considered supporting both formats, but decided that
it would lead to confusion as people would need to be familiar with two
formats instead of just one.

## Require build back-ends to update `pyproject.toml` when generating an sdist

When this PEP was written, sdists did not require having static,
canonical metadata like this PEP does. The idea was then considered to
use this PEP as a way to get such metadata into sdists. In the end,
though, the idea of updating `pyproject.toml` was not generally liked,
and so the idea was rejected in favour of separately pursuing
standardizing metadata in sdists.

## Allow tools to add/extend data

In an earlier version of this PEP, tools were allowed to extend data for
fields. For instance, build back-ends could take the version number and
add a local version for when they built the wheel. Tools could also add
more trove classifiers for things like the license or supported Python
versions.

In the end, though, it was thought better to start out stricter and
contemplate loosening how static the data could be considered based on
real-world usage.
