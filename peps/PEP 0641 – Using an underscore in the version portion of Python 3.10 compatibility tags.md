# Abstract

Note

This PEP was rejected due to potential breakage in the community.
::::

Using the tag system outlined in `425`{.interpreted-text role="pep"}
(primarily used for wheel file names), each release of Python specifies
compatibility tags (e.g. `cp39`, `py39` for CPython 3.9). For CPython
3.10, this PEP proposes using `3_10` as the version portion of the tags
(instead of `310`).

# Motivation

Up to this point, the version portion of compatibility tags used in e.g.
wheel file names has been a straight concatenation of the major and
minor versions of Python, both for the CPython interpreter tag and the
generic, interpreter-agnostic interpreter tag (e.g. `cp39` and `py39`,
respectively). This also applies to the ABI tag (e.g. `cp39`). Thanks to
both the major and minor versions being single digits, it has been
unambiguous what which digit in e.g. `39` represented.

But starting with Python 3.10, ambiguity comes up as `310` does not
clearly delineate whether the Python version is `3.10`, `31.0`, or `310`
as the major-only version of Python. Thus using `3_10` to separate
major/minor portions as allowed by `425`{.interpreted-text role="pep"}
disambiguates the Python version being supported.

# Rationale

Using `3_10` instead of another proposed separator is a restriction of
`425`{.interpreted-text role="pep"}, thus the only options are `3_10` or
`310`.

# Specification

The `SOABI` configure variable and
`sysconfig.get_config_var('py_version_nodot')` will be updated to use
`3_10` appropriately.

# Backwards Compatibility

Tools relying on the \'packaging\' project[^1] already expect a version
specification of `3_10` for Python 3.10. Keeping the version specifier
as `310` would require backing that change out and updating dependent
projects (e.g. pip).

Switching to `3_10` will impact any tools that implicitly rely on the
convention that the minor version is a single digit. However, these are
broken regardless of any change here.

For tools assuming the major version is only the first digit, they will
require updating if we switch to `3_10`.

In non-locale ASCII, `_` sorts after any digit, so lexicographic sorting
matching a sort by Python version of a wheel file name will be kept.

Since `515`{.interpreted-text role="pep"} (Python 3.6), underscores in
numeric literals are ignored. This means that `int("3_10")` and
`int("310")` produce the same result, and ordering based on conversion
to an integer will be preserved. **However**, this is still a bad way to
sort tags, and the point is raised here simply to show that this
proposal does not make things worse.

# Security Implications

There are no known security concerns.

# How to Teach This

As use of the interpreter tag is mostly machine-based and this PEP
disambiguates, there should not be any special teaching consideration
required.

# Reference Implementation

A pull request[^2] already exists adding support to CPython 3.10.
Support for reading wheel files with this proposed PEP is already
implemented.

# Rejected Ideas

## Not making the change

It was considered to not change the tag and stay with `310`. The
argument was it\'s less work and it won\'t break any existing tooling.
But in the end it was thought that the disambiguation is better to have.

# Open Issues

## How far should we take this?

Other places where the major and minor version are used could be updated
to use an underscore as well (e.g. `.pyc` files, the import path to the
zip file for the stdlib). It is not known how useful it would be to make
this pervasive.

## Standardizing on double digit minor version numbers

An alternative suggestion has been made to disambiguate where the major
and minor versions start/stop by forcing the minor version to always be
two digits, padding with a `0` as required. The advantages of this is it
makes the current `cp310` interpreter tag accurate, thus minimizing
breakage. It also does differentiate going forward.

There are a couple of drawbacks, though. One is the disambiguation only
exists *if* you know that the minor version number is two digits;
compare that to `cp3_10` which is unambiguous regardless of your base
knowledge. The potential for a three digit minor version number is also
not addressed by this two digit requirement.

There is also the issue of other interpreters not following the practice
in the past, present, or future. For instance, it is unknown if other
people have used a three digit version portion of the interpreter tag
previously for another interpreter where this rule would be incorrect.
This change would also suggest that interpreters which currently have a
single digit minor version \-- e.g. PyPy 7.3 \-- to change from `pp73`
to `pp703` or make the switch from their next minor release onward (e.g.
7.4 or 8.0). Otherwise this would make this rule exclusive to the `cp`
interpreter type which would make it more confusing for people.
