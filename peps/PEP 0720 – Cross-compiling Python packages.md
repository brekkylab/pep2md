# Abstract

This PEP attempts to document the status of cross-compilation of
downstream projects.

It should give an overview of the approaches currently used by
distributors (Linux distros, WASM environment providers, etc.) to
cross-compile downstream projects (3rd party extensions, etc.).

# Motivation

We write this PEP to express the challenges in cross-compilation and act
as a supporting document in future improvement proposals.

# Analysis

## Introduction

There are a couple different approaches being used to tackle this, with
different levels of interaction required from the user, but they all
require a significant amount of effort. This is due to the lack of
standardized cross-compilation infrastructure on the Python packaging
ecosystem, which itself stems from the complexity of cross-builds,
making it a huge undertaking.

## Upstream support

Some major projects like CPython, setuptools, etc. provide some support
to help with cross-compilation, but it\'s unofficial and at a
best-effort basis. For example, the `sysconfig` module allows
overwriting the data module name via the `_PYTHON_SYSCONFIGDATA_NAME`
environment variable, something that is required for cross-builds, and
setuptools [accepts
patches](https://github.com/pypa/distutils/pulls?q=cross)[^1] to
tweak/fix its logic to be compatible with popular [\"environment
faking\"](#faking-the-target-environment) workflows[^2].

The lack of first-party support in upstream projects leads to
cross-compilation being fragile and requiring a significant effort from
users, but at the same time, the lack of standardization makes it harder
for upstreams to improve support as there\'s no clarity on how this
feature should be provided.

### Projects with decent cross-build support

It seems relevant to point out that there are a few modern Python
package build-backends with, at least, decent cross-compilation support,
those being [scikit-build](https://github.com/pypa/distutils) and
[meson-python](https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build). Both these
projects integrate external mature build-systems into Python packaging
--- [CMake](https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson-python) and
[Meson](https://cmake.org/), respectively --- so cross-build support is
inherited from them.

## Downstream approaches

Cross-compilation approaches fall in a spectrum that goes from, by
design, requiring extensive user interaction to (ideally) almost none.
Usually, they\'ll be based on one of two main strategies, using a
[cross-build environment](#cross-build-environment), or [faking the
target environment](#faking-the-target-environment).

### Cross-build environment {#approach-cross-environment}

This consists of running the Python interpreter normally and utilizing
the cross-build provided by the projects\' build-system. However, as we
saw above, upstream support is lacking, so this approach only works for
a small-ish set of projects. When this fails, the usual strategy is to
patch the build-system code to build use the correct toolchain, system
details, etc.[^3].

Since this approach often requires package-specific patching, it
requires a lot of user interaction.

### Faking the target environment

Aiming to drop the requirement for user input, a popular approach is
trying to fake the target environment. It generally consists of
monkeypatching the Python interpreter to get it to mimic the interpreter
on the target system, which constitutes of changing many of the `sys`
module attributes, the `sysconfig` data, etc. Using this strategy,
build-backends do not need to have any cross-build support, and should
just work without any code changes.

Unfortunately, though, it isn\'t possible to truly fake the target
environment. There are many reasons for this, one of the main ones being
that it breaks code that actually needs to introspect the running
interpreter. As a result, monkeypatching Python to look like target is
very tricky --- to achieve the less amount of breakage, we can only
patch certain aspects of the interpreter. Consequently, build-backends
may need some code changes, but these are generally much smaller than
the previous approach. This is an inherent limitation of the technique,
meaning this strategy still requires some user interaction.

Nonetheless, this strategy still works out-of-the-box with significantly
more projects than the approach above, and requires much less effort in
these cases. It is successful in decreasing the amount of user
interaction needed, even though it doesn\'t succeed in being generic.

## Environment introspection

As explained above, most build system code is written with the
assumption that the target system is the same as where the build is
occurring, so introspection is usually used to guide the build.

In this section, we try to document most of the ways this is
accomplished. It should give a decent overview of of environment details
that are required by build systems.

## Relevant Information

There are some bits of information required by build systems --- eg.
platform particularities --- scattered across many places, and it often
is difficult to identify code with assumptions based on them. In this
section, we try to document the most relevant cases.

### When should extensions be linked against `libpython`?

Short answer

:   Yes, on Windows. No on POSIX platforms, except Android, Cygwin, and
    other Windows-based POSIX-like platforms.

When building extensions for dynamic loading, depending on the target
platform, they may need to be linked against `libpython`.

On Windows, extensions need to link against `libpython`, because all
symbols must be resolvable at link time. POSIX-like platforms based on
Windows --- like Cygwin, MinGW, or MSYS --- will also require linking
against `libpython`.

On most POSIX platforms, it is not necessary to link against
`libpython`, as the symbols will already be available due to the
interpreter --- or, when embedding, the executable/library in question
--- already linking to `libpython`. Not linking an extension module
against `libpython` will allow it to be loaded by static Python builds,
so when possible, it is desirable to do so (see
[GH-65735](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/intro.html#debugging-builds)).

This might not be the case on all POSIX platforms, so make sure you
check. One example is Android, where only the main executable and
`LD_PRELOAD` entries are considered to be `RTLD_GLOBAL` (meaning
dependencies are `RTLD_LOCAL`) [^12], which causes the `libpython`
symbols be unavailable when loading the extension.

### What are `prefix`, `exec_prefix`, `base_prefix`, and `base_exec_prefix`?

These are `sys` attributes [set in the Python
initialization](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/memory.html#pymalloc)
that describe the running environment. They refer to the prefix of
directories where installation/environment files are installed,
according to the table below.

  Name                 Target files                             Environment Scope
  -------------------- ---------------------------------------- -------------------
  `prefix`             platform independent (eg. pure Python)   site-specific
  `exec_prefix`        platform dependent (eg. native code)     site-specific
  `base_prefix`        platform independent (eg. pure Python)   installation-wide
  `base_exec_prefix`   platform dependent (eg. native code)     installation-wide

Because the site-specific prefixes will be different inside virtual
environments, checking `sys.prexix != sys.base_prefix` is commonly used
to check if we are in a virtual environment.

[^1]: At the time of writing (Jun 2023), setuptools\' compiler interface
    code, the component that most of affects cross-compilation, is
    developed on the [pypa/distutils](##REF##_) repository, which gets
    periodically synced to the setuptools repository.

[^2]: We specifically mention *popular* workflows, because this is not
    standardized. Though, many of the most popular implementations
    ([crossenv](##REF##crossenv), [conda-forge](##REF##conda-forge)\'s
    build system, etc.) work similarly, and this is what we are
    referring to here. For clarity, the implementations we are referring
    to here could be described as *crossenv-style*.

[^3]: The scope of the build-system patching varies between users and
    usually depends on the their goal --- some (eg. Linux distributions)
    may patch the build-system to support cross-builds, while others
    might hardcode compiler paths and system information in the
    build-system, to simply make the build work.

[^4]: Ideally, you want to perform cross-builds with the same Python
    version and implementation, however, this is often not the case. It
    should not be very problematic as long as the major and minor
    versions don\'t change.

[^5]: The set of config variables that will always be present mostly
    consists of variables needed to calculate the installation scheme
    paths.

[^6]: The context we refer here consists of the \"path initialization\",
    which is a process that happens in the interpreter startup and is
    responsible for figuring out which environment it is being run ---
    eg. global environment, virtual environment, etc. --- and setting
    `sys.prefix` and other attributes accordingly.

[^7]: This is because Windows builds may not use the `Makefile`, and
    instead [use the Visual Studio build system](##REF##_). A subset of
    the most relevant `Makefile` variables is provided to make user code
    that uses them simpler.

[^8]: Due to Python bring compiled without shared or static `libpython`
    support, respectively.

[^9]: This is the `libpython` library that users of the [stable
    ABI](##REF##_) should link against, if they need to link against
    `libpython`.

    support, respectively.
